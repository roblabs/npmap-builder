## Introduction

The Builder is under _very_ active development, so you will likely encounter bugs and/or areas of the intrace that still need some work. If you do, please take a few minutes to send us your feedback; user feedback helps us prioritize future development.

A few key points:

* Please _do not_ send feedback via email. Submit all feedback through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/npmap-builder/issues).
* If you run into an issue or have a _specific_ enhancement request, feel free to [create a new issue](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/npmap-builder/issues/new). Before doing this, take a look at the existing issues to ensure you aren't creating a duplicate request. If a request similar to yours has already been submitted, do not create a new one. Simply comment on the existing one, using "+1" comments to show your support for an existing issue.

## Support

The [NPMap team](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/team/) is here to help. We will answer any and all open issues as quickly as possible.
